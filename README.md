# apocalorie.co

**Apocalorie.co** is a survival web app built during **Hackabull 2025**, a 24-hour hackathon hosted at the University of South Florida (April 12–13, 2025).
This project was developed collaboratively by our team. This fork exists to showcase my (@EthanDelCampo) individual contributions. The original repository is owned by @Renblas, my teammate during the event.

In a post-apocalyptic world, food, calories, and danger zones are critical for survival.  
Our app helps users calculate their daily calorie needs, recommends forageable foods based on their location, tracks their food inventory, and shows danger zones on an interactive map.

## 🚀 Inspiration
In a post-apocalyptic world, survival would depend heavily on proper calorie intake and food management.  
We wanted to create a tool that could help users stay alive by recommending how much they should eat, what they can forage nearby, and what areas to avoid — all automatically.  
Plus, we wanted to learn new technologies and just have fun building something cool!

## 🛠️ Built With
- **JavaScript**
- **React.js** – Frontend framework
- **Node.js** – Backend runtime
- **Express.js** – Backend server
- **MongoDB** – (Optional) Database for storing user food inventory
- **CORS** – For backend API handling
- **Google Gemini API** – For generating AI survival food suggestions
- **OpenAI** – For enhancing AI content generation
- **Mapbox API** – For displaying interactive danger maps
- **dotenv** – For managing environment variables
- **fs** – For server file system operations
- **ngrok** – For secure tunneling during development

---

## ✨ What It Does
- Calculates daily calorie needs based on height, weight, age, sex, activity level, and location.
- Recommends forageable survival foods using AI (Google Gemini API).
- Allows users to track their food inventory and monitor calorie intake.
- Displays danger zones on an interactive map powered by Mapbox.

---

## ⚙️ How We Built It
- **React.js** for the frontend to make the web app fast and responsive.
- **Node.js** and **Express.js** for the backend to handle user data and API integrations.
- **MongoDB** (optional) to manage food inventories if deployed at scale.
- Integrated the **Google Gemini API** for smart food recommendations.
- Used the **Mapbox API** to dynamically show danger zones based on location data.

---

## 🧠 Challenges We Ran Into
- It was our **first hackathon ever**, so a lot of the technologies and working as a team under pressure were completely new.
- Managing time effectively — there’s always more to build than the time available!
- Figuring out how to prioritize and focus on the most meaningful features within a strict 24-hour window.
- Balancing learning new things while still making sure we had a finished, working project.

---

## 🏆 Accomplishments That We're Proud Of
- Building a working full-stack app in such a short amount of time.
- Successfully integrating multiple complex APIs like Google Gemini, OpenAI, and Mapbox.
- Designing a fun and functional survival tool.
- Most importantly: **having so much fun and completing our first hackathon**!

---

## 📚 What We Learned
- How to work effectively and prioritize tasks within a 24-hour sprint.
- How to collaborate as a team under tight time pressure.
- How to integrate multiple APIs into a single full-stack application.
- How to quickly decide between nice-to-haves and must-haves.

---

## 🔮 What's Next for apocalorie.co
- Making AI recommendations even smarter by tailoring them to the user's exact location, environment, and available resources.
- Integrating more APIs, such as a weather API, to provide real-time weather updates based on the user’s location — because surviving a sandstorm or freezing night could change everything.
- Expanding the danger maps with live updates and more detailed survival information.
